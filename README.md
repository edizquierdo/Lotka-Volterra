# Lotka-Volterra Dynamical Model 

This is code used as a tool for teaching dynamical systems. 

The Lotka–Volterra equations, also known as the predator–prey equations, are a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations, frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other as prey. 

The system of equations are implemented as a class in lotkavolterra.py. The second script instantiates the variables and simulates the system. 

## Instructions for use

1. Run simulation: 
```
$ python sim_lotkavolterra.py
```
